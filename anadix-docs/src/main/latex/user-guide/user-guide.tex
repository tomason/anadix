\chapter{Introduction}
Anadix is a tool for analyzing HTML files for Section 508 compliance. It uses
Drools rule engine as a core that is used to create classes from parsed HTML
elements and to evaluate rules checking Section 508 compliance. Anadix can be
extended to analyze any source using any set of conditions as long as source and
conditions share the same domain. You can for example change the parser that is
used for HTML file parsing with custom written parser using different HTML
parser implementation. Anadix also provides integration with different tools -
currently it is only Apache Ant, but integration with Selenium is planned.
